# Drousiness-Detector-using-Pytorch-and-YOLOV5
In this project we have created a drousiness detector which will tell whether you are awake or drousy. You will create a seperate Folder named Drousiness_detector, you can name it as per your choice, in that folder you will create a sub folder
data which will further consists of images and labels folders.In images folders you will collect images of yourself being awake and drousy which will help you to train your model and in labels folder you will label your images in YOLO format to get it recognized.
Then in yolov5 folder you will create a folder named dataset and it must be in a yml or yaml format.
